    "content3": "<p>\r\nThe phone is available in two distinct colours- Midnight Black, Purple Dawn. There’s a Realme logo at the bottom of the back panel, and a big circular camera module with two lenses and an LED flash on top. There is a slight protrusion of the camera module, but it does not change the device’s balance. But the phone attracts smudges and fingerprints easily which can be a major disadvantage. In terms of functionality, the Realme 11X 5G has a power button and volume rockers on the right edge, and a SIM tray on the left edge. There’s a 3.5mm jack for headphones, USB Type C port, speaker grille and one monophone in the bottom corner. The phone is 7.89 mm thick and weighs 190 grams, which makes it comfortable to hold for a long time. Overall, it has a decent design and build quality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Realme 11X 5G is equipped with a 6.72 inch FHD+ IPS display panel. Although it’s an LCD panel, the quality of the image is good. The picture is bright and precise, as are the angles of view. The dynamic range could be better. The display supports an adaptive refresh rate of 120 Hz for smooth scrolling.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Realme 11x Cameras</h2><p>\r\nThe Realme 11x 5G comes with a dual camera setup at the rear part with a 64MP primary and a 2MP portrait lens along with a 8MP front camera. The primary camera captures crisp and clear shots during the daytime with a good dynamic range and mostly similar colours. It clicks decent pictures in a good lighting condition. The phone features a 2x in-sensor zoom that captures stele telephoto-like images. The front camera clicks decent selfies which gives images with natural colour and clarity.\r\n</p>",
